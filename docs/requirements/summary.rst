Summary and Conclusion
======================

This document presented the results of the OPNFV NetReady (Network Readiness)
project. It described a selection of NFV-related networking use cases and their
corresponding networking requirements. Moreover, for every use case, it
describes an associated gap analysis which analyses the aforementioned
networking requirements with respect to the current OpenStack networking
architecture.

Based on the gap analyses, we draw the following conclusions:

* <add conclusions, to be agreed>
* Besides current requirements and gaps identified in support of NFV networking,
  more and more new NFV networking services are to be innovated in the near future.
  Those innovations will bring additional requirements, and more significant gaps
  will be expected. On the other hand, NFV networking business requires it
  to be made easy to innovate, quick to develop, and agile to deploy and operate.
  Therefore, a model-driven, extensible framework is expected to support NFV
  networking on-demand in order to accelerate time-to-market and achieve business
  agility for innovations in NFV networking business.
