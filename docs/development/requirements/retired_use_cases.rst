Retired Use Cases
=================

The following use cases have previously been analyzed in OPNFV Netready. Since
then, the identified gaps have been addressed and/or closed in the upstream
community.

These use cases are not removed from the document for the sake of completeness,
but moved to a separate chapter to keep the document structure clean.
